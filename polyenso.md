=================
This american experimental rock band began their music career as a post-hardcore group under the name of Oceana.
In 2012, the band changed their genre, their name and several of their members to become Polyenso. Their music now consists of a blend of electronic, jazz and indie rock, and they have released two albums under this name; "One Big Particular Loop" (2013) and "Pure in the Plastic" (2016).
In 2018 they opened their own venue in St Petersburg, Florida - Paper Crane.
